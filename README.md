# SEP10 Freedom Project Example
by Mr. Mueller

## Context
The Freedom Project for SEP10 is all about ___. 

The purpose of this blog is to document my process of___.

## Content
For my project, I am addressing the topic of CS Education and creating a website that also uses Jekyll. Titled **CS Everywhere**, my site exists to educate students about how CS can be used in just about any job. I decided to use Jekyll because I want the content of my site to be crowd-sourced, but I didn't want to expect contributors to know HTML/CSS. Instead, Jekyll turns simple markdown syntax into custom and consistent HTML/CSS automatically.
