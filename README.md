# SEP10 Freedom Project Example
by Mr. Mueller

## Context
The Freedom Project for SEP10 is all about ___. 

The purpose of this blog is to document my process of___.

## Content
For my project, I am addressing the topic of CS Education and creating a website that also uses Jekyll. Titled **CS Everywhere**, my site exists to educate students about how CS can be used in just about any job. I decided to use Jekyll because I want the content of my site to be crowd-sourced, but I didn't want to expect contributors to know HTML/CSS. Instead, Jekyll turns simple markdown syntax into custom and consistent HTML/CSS automatically.

## Implications
As with any creation, it is important to consider the possible positive and negative implications. I believe CSeverywhere will have mostly a positive impact on schools and the workforce.

One way this site will impact the world is through the education system. I believe this site will help our culture adopt a mentality that CS really is everywhere, and thus it should be taught more explicitly in schools, as with English, Math, Science, and History. Our society has already begun to adopt a mentality (and even systems) that "CS is for all." This initiative helps all students become exposed to computer science; however, this site will help the world understand that technology is not its own field, but rather it is integrated into every industry. Moving forward, it is possible that this site could push the initiative even further until CS education is woven into the fabric of students' education at every grade level, much like the other core subjects. It is possible that students go beyond simple exposure and become more fluent in the concepts of computer science.

If our education system pushes forward in this way, it is inevitable that future jobs will integrate technology even more, and it will become like two massive engines that are feeding each other: K-12 education and the job market. The obvious positive implication is that there is no foreseeable ceiling to this change; as technology changes and grows, so will curricula and job titles. However, a potential downside to this growth is that we can become so increasingly dependent on technology that we are crippled when it fails. As it stands, internet outages and especially power outages are incredibly debilitating. As more and more industries grow in their use of technology (because of CSeverywhere), it is possible that bugs, outages, and other failures cause more frustration than we can handle as a society. 

As the creator of this site and a firm believer that technology can help industries grow in positive ways, I am excited for the potential of future education and jobs. And at the same time, I urge every student and employee who implements computer science tactics to consider a "plan B" when (not if) your code breaks, you lose wifi, or the power goes out.
